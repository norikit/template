# Architectural decisions

Locked decisions are **constraints**. Do not relitigate without explicit owner direction.
When a new decision is made, add an entry here (newest at the bottom) and, if it resolves an
[open question](open-questions.md), replace that entry there with a one-line pointer.

Format: each decision has an **ID** (`D1`, `D2`, …), a status, the decision, and the
rationale (and consequences/risks where relevant). Tasks cite the `D#` they produce.

---

## D1 — Target platform & stack

- **Status:** _Proposed / Locked ({{DATE}})_
- **Decision:** _e.g. native Swift application targeting {{OS_FLOOR}}._ <!-- TEMPLATE -->
- **Rationale:** _Why this stack gives the best performance/feature set for this tool.
  Stack is a per-project choice, not a house default — justify it._

<!--
Record the rest of your day-one decisions as D2, D3, … Typical ones:
  - OS floor + availability-gating policy for newer features
  - Rendering / UI approach              (if the tool has a UI)
  - Configuration model                  (if the tool is user-configurable)
  - noriglaze theming integration        (strong default for anything with UI)
Each: Status / Decision / Rationale / Consequence.
